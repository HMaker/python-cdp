EventBreakpoints
================

EventBreakpoints permits setting JavaScript breakpoints on operations and events
occurring in native code invoked from JavaScript. Once breakpoint is hit, it is
reported through Debugger domain, similarly to regular breakpoints being hit.

*This CDP domain is experimental.*

Types

*There are no types in this module.*

Commands
--------

Each command is a generator function. The return
type ``Generator[x, y, z]`` indicates that the generator
*yields* arguments of type ``x``, it must be resumed with
an argument of type ``y``, and it returns type ``z``. In
this library, types ``x`` and ``y`` are the same for all
commands, and ``z`` is the return type you should pay attention
to. For more information, see
:ref:`Getting Started: Commands <getting-started-commands>`.
